# PyXPS
Python code to analyze  x-ray phonons spectroscopy (XPS) by deep learning (DL), including convolutional neural network (CNN) methods.


**PyXPS** is an python code library for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks to analyze XPS spectrum. The code is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other spectrum, as well.


## Installation
*TensorFlow and TFLearn are needed to run the code.

## Implementation
* Generate databases for training and testing
* Build a convolutional neural network model to recognize the number of peaks in the databases.
